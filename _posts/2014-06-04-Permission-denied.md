###1. git push origin master，报如下的错：
	    ✗ Permission denied (publickey).
		fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

		Please make sure you have the correct access rights
		and the repository exists.
    
###2. 网上查了一下，还是stackoverflow给力，[answer](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys)
